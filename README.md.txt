## Key Insights and Business Value
* **Burnout is the Top Predictor:** Employees reporting mandatory **OverTime** have an attrition rate of **30.5%**, nearly **3 times higher** than employees without overtime (11.9%).
* **Income Stress:** The majority of employees who left were clustered in the **lowest income brackets** (\$2,000 - \$3,500/month), suggesting wage competitiveness is a major issue for entry-level roles.
* **High Turnover in Early Tenure:** Over **40%** of all attrition occurred within an employee’s first **3 years** at the company, pointing to issues with onboarding or initial role fit.
* **Departmental Risk:** The **Sales Department** exhibited the highest attrition rate among major departments, requiring immediate attention.

## Data-Driven Recommendations
1.  **Overtime Policy Review:** Immediately investigate teams with high OverTime use and implement strict caps to mitigate burnout.
2.  **Targeted Salary Review:** Conduct a competitive analysis for roles within the \$2k-\$4k income band, particularly for roles in high-attrition departments like Sales.
3.  **Enhance Onboarding:** Implement structured check-ins and mentorship programs for employees during their first three years to improve early retention.
